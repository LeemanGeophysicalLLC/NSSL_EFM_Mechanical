# NSSL EFM Mechanical

The EFM also includes a range of mechanical components that support and protect the  
instrument during flight. These include machined parts, 3D-printed housings, laser-cut  
mounts, and structural elements made from foam and composite materials. The design  
prioritizes strength, low weight, and ease of assembly in the field. Detailed models,  
drawings, and documentation are maintained to ensure consistent fabrication and  
support future revisions.

See the [main instrument repo](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/NSSL_EFM_Instrument)
for documentation and the rest of the instrument.
